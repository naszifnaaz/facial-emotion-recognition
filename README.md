## ABSTRACT

Facial emotion recognition (FER) is an important topic in the fields of computer vision and artificial intelligence owing to its significant academic and commercial potential. Although FER can be conducted using multiple sensors, this project focuses on studies that exclusively use facial images which can be obtained in real time using a camera module, because visual expressions are one of the main information channels in interpersonal communication. The Human face emotions convey a lot of information on visually rather than articulately.

This is a Python program which uses Machine Learning techniques for Facial Emotion Recognition(FER). The program uses Machine learning to classify emotions to six, They are anger, sadness, happiness, surprise, disgust and fear.

The projects application as a real time emotion based music player is also considered.
